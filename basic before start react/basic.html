why to learn React ?
makes easy to manage & built complex frontend applications
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces 

when should i learn react ?
after mastering JavaScript
most project don't need react in initial phase 

why react was created?
phantom message problem (no consistency in UI)

ye problem hai kya 
state -> JS  (state ko js manage krta hai ) & UI -> DOM (UI ko html manage krta hai)
state & UI ko sync krna mushkil hai, yahan pe state aur ui mein hona chaiye baat(sync),
jo ki nhi ho rha tha, isliye react bnab

to react ko sbse pehle khan academy ne adapt kiya ,
uske baad unsplash ne react ko use kiya 

react ka sbse jyada usecase wahan hai jb hmara ui bahut bara hai,
ek button click hone pe bahut jgh state (variables) update ho raha hai, tb 
react bahut consistently kaam krta hai

don't learn react if you are not comfortable with JavaScript and dom manipulation

framework vs library
framework -> predefined structure, predefined way of doing things
library -> collection of functions, you can use them as per your need 
react is a library 


Topics to learn in react
-> core of react(state or UI manipulation, JSX )
-> component reusability
-> reusing of component(props)  (props -> properties(key : value pair))
-> How to propagate change (hooks) (hooks -> useState, useEffect)


Additional Addon to react
-> Router (React don't have inbuilt router)
-> state management (react don't have inbuilt state management)
     -> redux, redux toolkit, mobx, context api, zustand
-> class based component(legacy code) (class based component -> class based component is a way to create component in react)
-> BAAS Apps (Backend as a service) (firebase, supabase, hasura, amplify)
isme backend likhna nhi prta , direct backend ko use kr skte hain


->After React 
react is not a complete solution in most case
->SEO (search engine optimization), Browser render of JS is slow, no routing 

// we can learn framework after react
->Framework(Next JS, Gatsby JS, Remix)
